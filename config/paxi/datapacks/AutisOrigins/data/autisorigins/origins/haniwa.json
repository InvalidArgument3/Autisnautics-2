    "description": "Haniwa are peculiar creatures made of living clay. They once ruled a glorious kingdom, but when the land rose from the sea they were cut off from vital clay deposits, leaving them as a race of nomadic raiders.\nTheir ceramic physiology has many powerful immunities, but can easily shatter like a vase from direct impacts. They can produce a sonic-boom attack from their hollow bodies.",
