- strut placement fixed, nice
- jogging buttons need to be connected up 
- camera zoom scroll bleeds through parts UI

- connecting drivetrains
- a "pick part to hotbar" key would be useful, or pick part to hand
- inconsistency: tab is called "designer" but column in controls is called "builder"
- bug: moving editor orbit cam, before the designer transition animation finishes, rubberbands it back until you let it finish. same for returning from test drive

- pan controls are inverted from what's expected in blender (fixed). might be personal preference tho
- with the new jogging, I think automatic snapping can be removed entirely tbh. even in FPS mode



blender-like control preset suggestions:
note: using mmb for everything is kinda shit actually but for familiarity maybe we can set up a second preset for just the designer category

> move pan from shift + rclick to shift + mmb
> move center viewpoint to alt + mmb
> move orbit to mmb
> move zoom from ctrl + shift + rmbdrag to ctrl + mmbdrag
